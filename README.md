<!-- This project is a daily schedule keeper to keep track of meetings. -->
This project is a weather dahsboard to show you the forecast in your chosen cities.

## Description

<!-- This project allows the user to input important appointments and return to the page at a later date to review them. It tells the user the date at the top and indicates whether a given time block is past, present or future.

A key hurdle in creating this project was understanding how to target the necessary text area when a particular 'save' button was clicked. -->

This project allows the user to search for a city and be shown the current weather as well as the forecast over the next 5 days.

This project is not complete as I had struggles with certain aspects, so will need to be resubmitted once I am happy with it.

## Installation

## Usage
To use this application, type your city into the search field. It will save your search so you can refer back to it again later. It will show you todays forecast including the temperature, humidity and wind speeds. It will also show you the same information for the following 5 days.
